# Squares Count

This project solves the "How many squares?" problem. It includes functions to calculate the number of squares for a given number n from the user.

## Files

- `squares_count.h`: Header file containing function declarations.
- `squares_count.c`: Source file implementing the functions.
- `tests.c`: Source file with test cases.
- `main.c`: Source file for the main program.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use `./tests`. This will execute various test cases for the `countSquares` function.

## Running Main Program

To run the main program, use `./main`. This will prompt you to enter the value of n, and it will calculate the number of squares for the given n.

## Clean Up

To delete the compiled files, use `make clean`.


## Installation
